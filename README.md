# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

# codsoft_Task1

Ever wondered who survived the Titanic? 🧐🚢 Check out my latest project where I analyze the Titanic survival dataset to predict outcomes based on factors like gender, age, and class.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic survival dataset to predict survival outcomes based on various factors such as gender, age, and class. The aim is to uncover patterns and insights that contributed to survival rates during the tragic sinking of the Titanic.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which includes various features related to passengers, such as:
- PassengerId
- Name
- Gender
- Age
- Class (Pclass)
- SibSp (number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (number of parents/children aboard)
- Fare
- Embarked (port of embarkation)

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Loading:** Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas and examined its structure.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and removed non-numeric columns.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Created dummy variables for categorical features and defined age groups for analysis.
4. **Data Preprocessing:** Ensured all features were numeric and split the dataset into training and testing sets. Applied standard scaling for optimal model performance.
5. **Model Training:** Trained a Linear Regression model on the training data and made predictions on the test set.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. Visualized the confusion matrix as a bar plot.
7. **Real-World Application:** Developed a framework for predicting survival based on new passenger data input.

## Key Learnings
- **Data Preprocessing:** Gained experience in cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Developed skills in visualizing data to identify patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Learned the significance of creating relevant features to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation:** Hands-on experience with training models and assessing their performance.
- **Visualization Skills:** Enhanced skills in data visualization to effectively communicate insights.

Ever wondered who survived the Titanic? üßêüö¢ Check out my latest project where I analyze the Titanic survival dataset to predict outcomes based on factors like gender, age, and class.


Load the Titanic dataset with pandas, check data types, and handle missing values by replacing them with 'N/A'.
Clean the data by removing non-numeric columns like 'Name', 'Ticket', and 'Cabin'.
Create dummy variables for categorical features like 'Gender' and 'Embarked' and categorize age groups to analyze survival rates.
Preprocess the data to ensure all features are numeric and split it into training and testing sets.
Standardize the features using StandardScaler for optimal model performance.
Train a Linear Regression model, evaluate its accuracy with metrics like accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report, and visualize the confusion matrix in a bar plot.
Build a framework for predicting survival based on new passenger data.
Key learnings from this project:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared data by managing missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data to uncover patterns affecting survival rates.
Feature Engineering: Understood the significance of creating meaningful features for model performance.
Model Training and Evaluation: Gained experience in training a Linear Regression model and assessing its accuracy.
Real-World Application: Applied machine learning techniques to a real dataset.
Visualization Skills: Enhanced my data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
This project has equipped me with essential skills for my future in data science!
